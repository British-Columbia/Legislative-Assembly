## Obtaining point-in-time links

When referencing files from this repository, there is no guarantee that they will continue to exist indefinitely; for example, a restructure or rename could cause the link to become broken. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you use point-in-time links (also called permalinks). When you send a permalink, it will always show the exact version of the file you were looking at, even if it is changed or deleted.

This can be done by selecting the `...` dropdown menu and selecting Permalink.
