<h2>Interpretation</h2>
</div>

#### Short title

1. This Act may be cited as the Executive Appointments Act.

#### Definitions

2. (1) In this Actâ€”

   political and non-political positions and appointments are as specified in the Schedule;

   Deputy Premier is a political appointment and a Member of Executive Council.

3. (1) An Executive Council position not specified in the Schedule is presumed to be a political position.

   (2) This Act does not apply to a position which is not specified in the Schedule and is also not an Executive Council position.

4. For greater clarity, a nomination is the intention to appoint an individual subject to the approval of the Legislative Assembly, and a nomination may be retracted by Order in Council at any point prior to the approval of the Legislative Assembly being formally granted.

<h2>Appointments</h2>
</div>

#### Appointment

5. Subject to other applicable law, the Premier does not require approval of the Legislative Assembly for appointment to political positions.

6. (1) The Premier has, subject to subsection (2) and other applicable law, the absolute and exclusive discretion to make appointments by Order in Council.

   (2) The Premier must always seek the approval of the Legislative Assembly for appointment to non-political positions. For greater clarity, this subsection means that non-political officials are nominated for appointment rather than appointed directly.

#### Dismissal

7. The Premier has the absolute discretion to terminate a political appointment by Order in Council.

8. (1) The Premier has the discretion, subject to subsection (2), to terminate a non-political appointment by Order in Council.

   (2) A non-political appointment may only be terminated if the official:

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) has been convicted of an offence;

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) exhibits corruption or malfeasance;

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) neglects their duties; or

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) conducts themselves in a manner unbecoming of their position.

#### Restriction

9. An Executive Council appointment (except for Premier, but including Deputy Premier) is automatically and immediately terminated upon taking the oath of office if they are elected Premier.

10. The seat of a Member of Legislative Assembly is automatically and immediately vacated upon taking the oath of office if they are elected Premier.

11. A sitting, elected Premier may not stand for election to the Legislative Assembly.

<div align="center">
<h2>Amendments</h2>
</div>

12. (1) The Crown may, by letters patent, amend the Schedule.

    (2) For greater clarity, nothing in this section inhibits the right of the Legislative Assembly to make amendments to the Schedule by enactment.
