<summary>Explanatory Note</summary><blockquote>
This bill extends the limitation period. The limitation period is the time-frame between the commission of an offence, and the deadline by which prosecutors must file charges.

The current limitation periods are insufficient and do not account for extensive, long-running investigations into the most serious and persistent offenders.

The limitation periods are currently:

- 60 days for indictable offences
- 45 days for hybrid offences
- 30 days for summary offences
- 15 days for traffic offences

This bill increases the limitation period for indictable offences from 60 days to 120 days, and for hybrid offences from 45 days to 90 days.

Summary and traffic offences are unchanged.

#### Short title
