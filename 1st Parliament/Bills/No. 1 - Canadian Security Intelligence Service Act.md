<h2>Canadian Security Intelligence Service</h2>
</div>

**Establishment of service**

3. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (the “Service”) is hereby established.

4. (1) The function of the Service shall be the protection of national security and, in particular, its protection against threats from–

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) espionage, terrorism, sedition, and sabotage;

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the activities of foreign powers and criminal or terrorist organisations; and

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) actions intended to overthrow or undermine parliamentary democracy.

   (2) It shall also be the function of the Service to safeguard and protect against threats to the social, political, and economic security and stability of British Columbia and of friendly states.

   (3) It shall also be the function of the Service to act in support of the activities of law enforcement agencies and the Ministry of Justice in the prevention and detection of serious or organised crime.

   (4) It shall also be the function of the Service to develop and produce research, analysis, collections, datasets, assessments, or similar when necessary for the development and delivery of government policy.

   (5) It shall also be the function of the Service to identify and collect information or assets which may be relevant in the discharge of its functions.

5. Additional functions of the Service may be provided through an Order in Council.

6. The Service may assume investigative jurisdiction over matters relevant in the discharge of its functions.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This part establishes CSIS and sets out its 'functions', the things which it's responsible for. These are:

- The protection of national security, especially from
  - espionage, terrorism, sedition and sabotage
  - the activities of foreign powers as well as criminal or terrorist groups
  - actions intended to overthrow or undermine British Columbia's democracy
- Safeguarding social, political and economic security
- Supporting law enforcement and prosecutors in preventing and detecting serious crime
- Producing research to support government policy
- To collect information which may be helpful for its functions

This part also allows for an Order in Council, a legislative instrument, to add additional functions. For example, if sudden or unforeseeable changes happen to the threats British Columbia faces.

This part also states that CSIS has jurisdiction over matters which relate to its functions.

</blockquote></details>

**Director of the Service**

7. (1) The Service shall be under the control and management of a Director, nominated by the Premier.

   (2) The Director shall be recognised as the head of the Service, sit on the Executive Council, and advise the Premier on security matters.

   (3) The Director shall be responsible for the efficiency of the Service, and it shall be his or her duty to ensure—

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that the Service does not take any action to further the interests of any political candidate or prospective political candidate standing in British Columbia; and

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) that the work of the Service is conducted lawfully and proportionately.

8. The Director shall make a quarterly report on the work of the Service to the Premier. The Director or Principal Deputy Director may at any time report to the Premier on any matter relating to the work of the Service.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This part sets out the role of the Director, which includes the efficiency of CSIS as well as ensuring that CSIS does not further political interests and that CSIS' work is lawful and appropriate.
</blockquote></details>

**Employees of the Service**

9. (1) The Director has exclusive authority to appoint employees and may delegate this authority under any conditions he or she sees fit. The identity of employees (except for the Director) shall not be a matter of public record except for where provided by the Director.

   (2) For greater clarity, all employees shall be viewed as officers and officials of the government.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This section sets out that, unless the Director says otherwise, the identities of CSIS employees isn't public record. This means that CSIS' work must be covert, which makes it harder for criminals to know who intelligence officers are.
</blockquote></details>

10. No element of the Revised Employee Rights Bylaw shall apply to employees in relation to their employment with the Service, and the obligations placed upon employers under the Revised Employee Rights Bylaw shall not apply to the Service.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This section is based on the Defence By-law. It means that employment law, which does things like set limits on administrative leave, does not apply to CSIS. This is necessary to ensure that CSIS' work remains secret and to ensure accountability, so CSIS can ensure it holds itself to high standards. CSIS has stated that it's in its interest to still treat its employees fair and reasonably, otherwise it would negatively effect morale and recruitment.
</blockquote></details>

11. The Director may designate an employee to be the Principal Deputy Director of the Service. The Principal Deputy Director shall be recognised as the deputy head of the Service.

12. The Director or Principal Deputy Director may designate an employee as a _designated senior employee_.

13. Employees shall, in carrying out the functions of the service, have—

    (a) the same protections under the law as peace officers have in performing their duties and functions as peace officers; and

    (b) the power to detain a person, and to search said person or relevant property, who–

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the employee has a genuine belief is about to commit, is currently committing, or has just committed an offence, and the employee reasonably believes either that necessary evidence would be lost if not for the detainment or search or that the detainment or search is necessary in the interests of the security or prosperity of British Columbia; or

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the employee has been authorised to detain or search by an on-duty peace officer or service member and the detainment or search is necessary in the discharge of the service’s functions.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This section sets out the limited powers that employees have.

Paragraph (a) is copied from the real-world CSIS Act and means that employees have the same protections as peace officers, such as reasonable force. This paragraph does not grant any powers; for example, CSIS officers are not granted the power to arrest people.

Paragraph (b) sets out the rare circumstances in which CSIS officers may detain a person and/or conduct searches. CSIS has stated that it intends this power to be used in exceptional circumstances only, as (per common law) it would require an officer to disclose their identity. One example of when this power may be invoked is when a person is under surveillance and the officer witnesses a deal occur, with there being no law enforcement partners nearby to intervene.

</blockquote></details>

**Unlawful conduct**

14. (1) If the Director is of the opinion that an employee may, on a particular occasion, have acted unlawfully in the purported performance of the functions of the Service, the Director shall cause a full investigation in respect thereof to occur.

    (2) If the Director is of the opinion that the unlawful conduct may amount to a criminal offence in British Columbia, the Director shall at a convenient time cause to be submitted a report to the Premier and Attorney General upon the completion of such an investigation.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This section is based on the real-world CSIS Act. Because CSIS' work is secret, it must be ensured that it is accountable and acts lawfully.

Subsection (1) requires the Director to investigate any unlawful conduct which a CSIS officer could have committed.

If that unlawful conduct is a crime, subsection (2) requires the Director to submit a report to the Premier and Attorney General on that conduct.

</blockquote></details>

**Legal proceedings**

15. (1) A civil action for torts committed by an employee in the performance of the functions of the Service lies with the Service and no legal proceeding for damages may be commenced against and in the name of an employee unless the Director provides otherwise.

    (2) The Attorney General shall represent the Service in any legal proceedings against it unless otherwise provided for by the Premier or Director.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This section helps ensure that CSIS' work remains secret. Subsection (1) means that CSIS can be sued for the actions of its employees; it does allow the Director waives this (in which case the employee would have to be sued personally, as is the case with police officers), for example if CSIS has fired an employee in connection with their actions. It does not remove criminal liability.
</blockquote></details>

**Measures to reduce threats**

16. (1) If there are reasonable grounds to believe that a particular activity constitutes a threat to the security of British Columbia, the Service may take measures, within or outside British Columbia, to reduce the threat.

    (2) The measures shall be reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances, having regard to the nature of the threat, the nature of the measures, the reasonable availability of other means to reduce the threat, and the reasonably foreseeable effects on third parties.

    (3) In taking measures to reduce a threat to the security of British Columbia, the Service shall not–

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) wilfully attempt in any manner to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) subject an individual to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; or

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) cause a person within British Columbia to have their legal rights infringed without just cause.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This section allows CSIS to take reasonable and proportionate measures to reduce threats to the security of British Columbia. Examples of such threats include terrorism, coup d'états, and foreign spies.

Subsections (2) and (3) set limitations on this, prohibiting CSIS from taking measures which are inappropriate, excessive, or violate legal rights.

</blockquote></details>

**Immunity**

17. (1) Employees, peace officers and service members of any part of an agency which is – for the time being – required by the Director to assist the Service in carrying out its functions, and agents acting under the direction of one of the aforementioned in connection with the functions of the Service shall be protected from any charges, liability, or adverse action where they have acted reasonably, proportionately, and in good faith and within the confines of subsection (2), unless waived by the Director.

    (2) The exemption under subsection (1) shall only apply if the act or omission was authorised before or within 12 hours of the act or omission by a designated senior employee and the act or omission was either in the interests of the security and prosperity of British Columbia or necessary for the purpose of establishing or maintaining a covert identity in connection with the functions of the Service.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This section allows senior CSIS officers to provide immunity to CSIS officers, agents (confidential informants), and partner agencies who are helping CSIS. Subsection (1) requires them to act reasonably, proportionately, and in good faith; it also allows the Director to revoke immunity.

Subsection (2) limits this immunity further, requiring the act to have been in the interests of the security or prosperity of British Columbia, or necessary for establishing or maintaining a cover identity but only if necessary for CSIS' functions.

</blockquote></details>

18. (1) The Director or Principal Deputy Director, with the consent of the Premier or Attorney General, may provide that a person be granted immunity from criminal liability in connection with acts or omissions already committed where the grant of immunity is necessary for the discharge of the functions of the Service, the person agrees to assist the Service in the discharge of its functions, and there is no reason to believe either that the grant of immunity would threaten the security or prosperity of British Columbia or that the person is actively affiliated or will affiliate with a hostile foreign state or terrorist group.

    (2) The effect of such a grant shall be that a prosecution cannot be commenced in relation to offences covered by the grant of immunity.

    (3) A grant of immunity does not extend to offences already charged or prosecuted nor does it extend to criminal convictions.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This section allows executive CSIS officers to give a person immunity for acts previously committed, but requiring the permission of the Premier or Attorney General.

This power is extremely limited, requiring the immunity to be necessary, the person agreeing to help the service. Subsection (1) prohibits immunity if granting it would threaten security or if the person is or will affiliate with a hostile foreign state or terrorist group.

Subsection (2) clarifies the effect of immunity, meaning it just prevents prosecution. Subsection (3) limits this immunity, so it can't be used if a person has been arrested or convicted.

</blockquote></details>

**Prohibition on disclosure**

19. (1) No person shall, in a proceeding before a court, person, or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, disclose the identity of an agent or employee or any information from which the identity of an agent or employee could be inferred.

    (2) The identity of an agent or information from which the identity of an agent could be inferred may be disclosed in a proceeding if the agent and the Director consent to the disclosure of that information.

    (3) The identity of an employee or information from which the identity of an employee could be inferred may be disclosed in a proceeding if the Director consents to the disclosure of that information.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This section is copied from the real-world CSIS Act. It helps ensure that CSIS' work remains covert, and legally protects people who provide it with information (agents).

</blockquote></details>

<div align="center">
<h2>Warrants</h2>
</div>

**Application**

20. The Service may apply for a court to issue a warrant for the arrest or search of a person or of property in the same fashion as peace officers.

21. (1) Affidavits by employees in connection with an application for a warrant shall be signed and submitted on behalf of the Service so as to protect the identities of employees.

    (2) Exhibits submitted by the Service in connection with an application for a warrant may be redacted by the Service so as to protect the identities of employees and agents or to prevent damage to intelligence or defence capabilities.

22. Any hearings pertaining to a warrant applied for on behalf of the Service shall be sealed and held in closed court unless otherwise provided by the Director or Attorney General.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This part allows CSIS to apply for warrants. Because subjects can get a copy of warrants, this part protects the identity of CSIS employees who apply for warrants, and allow for exhibits to be redacted to protect CSIS employees, informants (agents), or secret techniques (capabilities).

</blockquote></details>

**Editing of copies**

23. (1) Where an accused or related party applies for an order for the copying and examination of documents pertaining to a warrant applied for by the Service, the judge shall not provide any copy of any document to the accused or related party until the prosecutor or government has deleted any part of the copy of the document that the prosecutor or government believes, supported by the Director or Principal Deputy Director, would be prejudicial to the public interest, including any part that the prosecutor or government believes could:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) compromise the identity of any agent or confidential informant;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) compromise the nature and extent of either ongoing investigations or operations, or intelligence or defence capabilities;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) endanger persons engaged in particular intelligence gathering techniques and thereby prejudice future investigations or operations in which similar techniques would be used; or

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) prejudice the interests of innocent persons.

    (2) After the prosecutor or government has deleted the parts of the copy of the document, the accused or related party shall be provided with an edited copy of the document.

    (3) After the accused or related party has received an edited copy of a document, the prosecutor or government shall keep a copy of the original document, and an edited copy of the document and the original document shall be returned to the packet and the packet resealed.

    (4) An accused or related party to whom an edited copy of a document has been provided may request that the judge before whom the trial or hearing is to be held order that any part of the document deleted by the prosecutor or government be made available to the accused or related party, and the judge shall order that a copy of any part that, in the opinion of the judge, is required in order for the accused or related party to make full answer and defence and for which the provision of a judicial summary would not be sufficient, be made available to the accused or related party.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
This section is copied from the real-world CSIS Act, but expanded to include the government and opposing party more generally, rather than just prosecution and accused, as warrant cases are usually heard on application.

This section allows CSIS to protect sensitive information while also ensuring that a person's legal rights are not impeded. This section only applies to warrants requested by CSIS, which may be referenced in prosecutions or other hearings.

</blockquote></details>

<div align="center">
<h3>Interception</h3>
</div>

**Application**

24. (1) The Service may apply, _ex parte_ and in writing, to a judge for the issue of an interception warrant, such application being accompanied by an affidavit, sworn on the information and belief of a peace officer, employee, or service member and deposing to the following matters:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an offence has been or will be committed;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the nature or particulars of that offence;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the type of interception which is proposed;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) the identities of the persons, if known, to whom interception is proposed, a general description of the place at which interception is proposed, if a general description of that place can be given, and generally describe the manner of interception that is proposed;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) the number of instances, if any, of which an application under this section in relation to the offence and person or place named under paragraph (d) and on which the application was withdrawn or no authorisation was given, the date on which each application was made and the name of the judge to whom each application was made;

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) the period for which the authorisation is requested; and

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) whether other investigative procedures have been tried and have failed, why it appears they are unlikely to succeed, or that the urgency or seriousness of the matter is such that it would be impractical to carry out the investigation of the offence using only other investigative messages, unless the offence is that of espionage (as defined in the Defence by-law), terrorism (as defined in the Offences by-law), or an offence which it is believed has or will be committed at the direction or in association with or for the benefit of a foreign state or criminal organisation.

    (2) In exigent circumstances which threaten the security or prosperity of British Columbia, which present grave danger to the prospects of a successful prosecution, or which present an imminent and credible threat to any person or to property, the Service may make an application to a judge verbally, and the judge may provide authorisation by the same but not for a period exceeding 72 hours. Such an authorisation is not eligible for renewal.

25. For greater certainty, this Act does not prevent the Service from undertaking interception if that interception is justified under other law.

**When authorised**

26. An authorisation given under the above section shall—

    (a) state the offence in respect of which interception is authorised;

    (b) state the type of interception which is authorised;

    (c) state the identity of the persons, if known, to whom interception may be targeted, generally describe the place at which interception is authorised, if a general description of that place can be given, and generally describe the manner of interception that is authorised;

    (d) contain the terms and conditions, if any, that the judge considers necessary in the public interest and due administration of justice; and

    (e) be valid for the period, not exceeding sixty days, set out therein.

27. For greater certainty, an authorisation that permits interception by means of an electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device includes the authority to install, maintain or remove the device covertly.

**Removal of device**

28. On an _ex parte_ application, in writing, supported by affidavit, a judge may give a further authorisation for the covert removal of an electro-magnetic, acoustic, mechanical or other device after the expiry of the original authorisation—

    (a) under any terms or conditions that the judge considers necessary in the public interest and due administration of justice; and

    (b) during any specified period of not more than sixty days.

**When unauthorised**

29. A designated senior employee may authorise for the Service to undertake interception for up to 24 hours without an authorisation where the designated senior employee has reasonable grounds to believe that—

    (a) the urgency of the situation is such that an authorisation could not, with reasonable diligence, be obtained under the above provisions;

    (b) the interception is immediately necessary to prevent an offence that would cause serious harm to any person or to property; and

    (c) having regard to all the relevant circumstances, that the interception is reasonable and proportionate.

**Renewal**

30. (1) Renewals of an authorisation may be given by a judge on receipt by him or her of an ex parte application in writing signed by the Attorney General or Premier – or a person designated specifically in writing by either for this purpose – accompanied by an affidavit of a peace officer, service member, or employee deposing to the following matters:

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the reason and period for which the renewal is required,

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) full particulars, together with times and dates, when interceptions, if any, were made or attempted under the authorisation, and any information that has been obtained by way of interception, and

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the number of instances, if any, on which, to the knowledge and belief of the deponent, an application has been made under this section in relation to the same authorisation and on which the application was withdrawn or no renewal was given, the date on which each application was made and the name of the judge to whom each application was made,

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and supported by such other information as the judge may require.

    (2) A renewal of an authorisation may be given if the judge to whom the application is made is satisfied that the interception is still necessary, but no renewal shall be for a period exceeding sixty days.

<details>
<summary>Explanatory Notes</summary><blockquote>
The Interception part is copied from the real-world CSIS Act, but has been adjusted to fit the video game context. It establishes a framework for CSIS to request the authority to use wiretaps and other intrusive surveillance techniques, and for judges to oversee this.
