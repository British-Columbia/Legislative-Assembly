HIS MAJESTY, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of British Columbia, enacts as follows:

#### Definitions

1. In this Act:

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) a person appointed as a deputy minister under section 6, or

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the head of the public service;

   **"employee"** means a person appointed under this Act or a person employed by an organisation this Act applies to;

   **"*Executive Appointments Act*"** means the *Executive Appointments Act*, RSBC 2024, c. 19;

   **"minister"** means a Member of Executive Council and includes the Premier;

   **"reason plausible"** includes the reasons defined in section 8(2) of the *Executive Appointments Act*;

   **"senior public service"** consists of

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) the deputy ministers,

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) the associate deputy ministers, and

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) the assistant deputy ministers.

#### Application of Act

2. Except as otherwise provided in this Act or in another Act, this Act applies

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) to all ministries of the government, including the Office of the Premier, and

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) to any board, agency, department, executive office, or organisation of the government and its members or employees, to which the Lieutenant Governor in Council declares this Act, or a provision of this Act, to apply.

#### BC Public Service

3. There shall continue to be a permanent, politically impartial workforce under the administration of the Executive Council.

#### Head of the public service

4. (1) The Clerk of the Executive Council shall continue to be the head of the public service.

   (2) The head of the public service is responsible for the management of the public service, including without limitation the following:

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) advising the Premier respecting personnel policies, standards, regulations, and procedures;

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) providing direction, advice, or assistance to ministries in the conduct of personnel policies, standards, regulations, and procedures;

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) recruiting, selecting and appointing, or providing for the recruitment, selection and/or appointment of, persons to or within the public service or for non-political positions which the Premier makes or recommends appointment;

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) establishing and maintaining a personnel management information system for the public service, if he or she considers it necessary; and

   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) performing other duties assigned by the Premier.

#### Deputy ministers

5. (1) The Lieutenant Governor in Council may appoint deputy ministers, associate deputy ministers, and assistant deputy ministers.

   (2) A deputy minister has the power to act on behalf of their corresponding minister subject to any conditions or limitations the minister may communicate, but this does not extend to any powers which are ascribed specifically to the Premier or Deputy Premier.

8. A person may be appointed to the public service in circumstances the head of the public service shall prescribe, but the head of the public service has no authority over appointments to the senior public service.

9. All appointments to the public service, whether by the head of the public service or by the Lieutenant Governor in Council, shall be made on the basis of merit exclusively.
